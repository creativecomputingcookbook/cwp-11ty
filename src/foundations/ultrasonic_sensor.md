A **ultrasonic sensor** is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. What is an ultrasonic sensor? It is a device that uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an objectâ€™s proximity. High-frequency sound waves reflect across boundaries to produce distinct echo patterns.

#### Step 1: Hook-Up your Controller

We used an Arduino in this example, but you can use another controller and program of your choice.

#### Step 2: Install relevant coding software to your PC

Install Arduino Sketch coding software on your PC. This is where you type the code you want to compile and send it to the Arduino board.

#### Step 3: Set-up your sensor with Arduino

Plug your Arduino into the USB cable and into your computer. Once you upload Arduino, you can then compile and activate the code.
</step>

<div slot="left">

```arduino
const int anPin = 0;

long anVolt, cm;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void read_sensor(){
  anVolt = analogRead(anPin);
  cm = anVolt / 2;
}

void print_range(){
  Serial.print("Range = ");
  Serial.print(cm);
  Serial.print(" cm ");
  Serial.print('\n');
}

void loop() {
  read_sensor();
  print_range();
  delay(100);
}
```

</div>
#### Step 4: Compile and run your code

The code above will allow you to read distances in centimeters. Compile and run this code to obtain real-time distance measurements to the closest object.
