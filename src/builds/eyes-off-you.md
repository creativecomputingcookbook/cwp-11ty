STEM From Dance instructors choreographed a piece to "Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You," featuring a boombox prop equipped with sensors. They experimented with different movements to activate the sensors, realizing that dramatic up-and-down motions worked especially well with the tilt sensor. 

Using two props encouraged collaboration, as dancers created interactive moments and adapted to each other’s styles. The placement of the sensors inspired creative movement across different levels—like crouching to press a button that changed colors or tilting the boombox to pass it between partners—pushing dancers to explore new ways of expressing themselves through technology and choreography.
