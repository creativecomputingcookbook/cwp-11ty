"Corporate in Red" is an interactive art installation by Gab Lucto, Hannah Lucto, and Shahariar Rahman that uses mechanical engineering, visual storytelling, and audience interaction—through servo motors, gears, switches, and a potentiometer—to explore the emotional unraveling of a corporate worker, contrasting repression and control with the instability of life outside corporate systems.
